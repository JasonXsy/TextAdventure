magic system:
- battle magic
- non-battle magic (healing)
- all magic shows relevant text
- spells follow a general template
- some spells could be used to summon something like an NPC
    - this NPC could possibly then fight on your behalf
- spell to swap bodies with someone for a limited set amount of time including an NPC
- these last few specialty spells cannot be templated and have their own functions
- how to acquire spells:
  - from a magic shop?
- players learn spells once and can use it infinitely from thereon
- spell use only limited to the amount of MP (magic points) a player has
- spells consume set amount of MP per use
- if you die while in an NPC body, you should immediately respawn in a new NPC body
  - spawn at a set spawn point. No random spawn points

Money:
- players have gold either in inventory or as a separate value.
- used for purchasing goods

Shops:
- sell only spells for now
- have a set inventory with specific quantity of each item (make quantity infinite for now, may limit later)
- 

Communication:
- when in a shop, interactions with the store clerk are not broadcasted to all in room
